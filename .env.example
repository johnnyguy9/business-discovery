# API Configuration
#
# Local Development:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
#
# Production (set in Vercel Dashboard):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.pointwakeglobal.com
#
# This variable tells the frontend where the FastAPI backend is located.
# For local dev, copy this file to .env.local and use localhost.
# For Vercel production, set this in: Settings > Environment Variables
#
# IMPORTANT: Production MUST use HTTPS (Cloudflare subdomain) to avoid
# mixed content errors when frontend is served over HTTPS.
